@techreport{Goldstein2016,
abstract = {According to statistical mechanics, micro-states of an isolated physical system (say, a gas in a box) at time t 0 in a given macro-state of less-than-maximal en-tropy typically evolve in such a way that the entropy at time t increases with |t − t 0 | in both time directions. In order to account for the observed entropy increase in only one time direction, the thermodynamic arrow of time, one usually appeals to the hypothesis that the initial state of the universe was one of very low entropy. In certain recent models of cosmology, however, no hypothesis about the initial state of the universe is invoked. We discuss how the emergence of a thermodynamic arrow of time in such models can nevertheless be compatible with the above-mentioned consequence of statistical mechanics, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.},

@article{Carroll2005,
abstract = {If our universe underwent inflation, its entropy during the inflationary phase was substantially lower than it is today. Because a low-entropy state is less likely to be chosen randomly than a high-entropy one, inflation is unlikely to arise through randomly-chosen initial conditions. To resolve this puzzle, we examine the notion of a natural state for the universe, and argue that it is a nearly-empty spacetime. If empty space has a small vacuum energy, however, inflation can begin spontaneously in this background. This scenario explains why a universe like ours is likely to have begun via a period of inflation, and also provides an origin for the cosmological arrow of time. Keywords Cosmology {\textperiodcentered} Inflation {\textperiodcentered} Arrow of time As far as we know, there is only one universe. At least, there are not multiple universes between which we can easily travel; we only have access to the universe we are in, and (because there is a finite time back to a dense early stage past which we can't see) we can only experience a finite portion of that. So we are stuck with the universe, and in principle we simply have to accept the conditions we see. Nevertheless, there is an irresistible temptation to try to explain the state in which we find our universe as the practically-inevitable outcome of some dynamical processes. The most celebrated attempt along these lines has been the theory of inflation [1-3], which purports to explain the flatness, *},

@incollection{Lineweaver,
abstract = {If the universe had been born in a high entropy, equilibrium state, there would be no stars, no planets and no life. Thus, the initial low entropy of the universe is the fundamental reason why we are here. However, we have a poor understanding of why the initial entropy was low and of the relationship between gravity and entropy. We are also struggling with how to meaningfully define the maximum entropy of the universe. This is important because the entropy gap between the maximum entropy of the universe and the actual entropy of the universe is a measure of the free energy left in the universe to drive all processes. I review these entropic issues and the entropy budget of the universe. I argue that the low initial entropy of the universe could be the result of the inflationary origin of matter from unclumpable false vacuum energy. The entropy of massive black holes dominates the entropy budget of the universe. The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the square of its mass. Therefore, determining whether the Maximum Entropy Production Principle (MaxEP) applies to the entropy of the universe is equivalent to determining whether the accretion disks around black holes are maximally efficient at dumping mass onto the central black hole. In an attempt to make this question more precise, I review the magnetic angular momentum transport mechanisms of accretion disks that are responsible for increasing the masses of black holes 22.1 The Entropy of the Observable Universe Stars are shining, supernovae are exploding, black holes are forming, winds on planetary surfaces are blowing dust around, and hot things like coffee mugs are cooling down. Thus, the entropy of the universe S uni , is increasing, and has been},

@article{Carroll2004a,
abstract = {We suggest that spontaneous eternal inflation can provide a natural explanation for the thermodynamic arrow of time, and discuss the underlying assumptions and consequences of this view. In the absence of inflation, we argue that systems coupled to gravity usually evolve asymptotically to the vacuum, which is the only natural state in a thermodynamic sense. In the presence of a small positive vacuum energy and an appropriate inflaton field, the de Sitter vacuum is unstable to the spontaneous onset of inflation at a higher energy scale. Starting from de Sitter, inflation can increase the total entropy of the universe without bound, creating universes similar to ours in the process. An important consequence of this picture is that inflation occurs asymptotically both forwards and backwards in time, implying a universe that is (statistically) time-symmetric on ultra-large scales.},
